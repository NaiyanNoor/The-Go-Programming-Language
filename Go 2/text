Go Variables


Variables are containers for storing data values.

Go Variable Types
In Go, there are different types of variables, for example:

int- stores integers (whole numbers), such as 123 or -123
float32- stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
bool- stores values with two states: true or false
More about different variable types, will be explained in the Go Data Types chapter.
